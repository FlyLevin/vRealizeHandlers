# vRealizeHandlers

This handlers complete some higher level actions based on the vRealize restful API.

Some parameters need to configured manually like vRA_username, password which should be the administratior of the working group.

Currently we are using the smb to mount the vRA iso folder.

It completes the snapshot revert, snapshot delete, create snapshot and mount CD install actions.

All are based on the vRrealize API
